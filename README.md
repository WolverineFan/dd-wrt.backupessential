Script and config files to back up settings on a DD-WRT router

This script has been called backupvars.sh and backupessential over time.  This repository is an attempt to preserve the history of the script as it has evolved.

Since I'm not sure of the wishes of the original authors, I am placing my contribution (this repository) in the public domain.
